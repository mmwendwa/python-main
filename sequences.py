#                                                                 3.  A dict is a collection of key-value pairs

#4. Tuples are for storing  pairs of values that are not going to change eg x and y coordinates (a sequence of immutable values)

# instead of using; coordinateX = 10.0
#                   coordinateY = 20.0    you can use a tuple:

#                   cordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
